# Search Problem

### Agent

**Reflex agent**: selects an actions solely based on the current state. 

**Planning agent**: maintains a model of the world, simulates performing various actions, determines hypothesized consequences of actions, and selects the best one

Planning agent usually outperforms reflex agents.



### Search Problem

A search problem is formulated by:

- State space - the set of all possible states in the given world
- Successor fn - a fn that takes in a state and an action, and computes the cost of the action and the successor states
- Start state - the initial state of the agent
- Goal test - a fn that takes in a state and determines that whether it is a goal state

A search problem is solved by starting from the start state and iteratively exploring the state space by calling the successor fn until reaching the goal state, at which point a path is determined.

##### State Space Graphs

Constructed with states representing nodes, with directed edges existing from a state to its successors. These edges represent actions, and any associated weights represent the cost of performing the corresponding action. In a graph, each state is represented exactly once.

##### Search Trees

Each node encodes  the entire path from the start state to the given state in the state space graph.

No restriction on the number of times a state can appear. Greater than or equal to their corresponding state space graph in size.



### Uninformed Search

Maintain an outer fringe of partial plans. Expand our fringe by removing a node and replacing
it on the fringe with all its children. Continue this until eventually removing a goal state off the fringe.

Known as tree search.

##### Pseudocode

```
function TREE-SEARCH(problem, fringe) return solution, or failure
	fringe <- INSERT(MAKE-NODE(INITIAL-STATE[problem]), fringe)
	loop do
		if fringe is empty then return failure
		node <- REMOVE-FRONT(fringe)
		if GOAL-TEST(problem, STATE[node]) then return node
		for child-node in EXPAND(STATE[node], problem) do
			fringe <- INSERT(child-node, fringe)
		end
	end
```

##### Strategies

DFS, BFS, UCS (Uniform Cost Search). Different strategies have different fringe representation.

##### Properties

- Completeness: If there exists a solution to the search problem, whether the strategy is guaranteed to find a solution.

- Optimality: whether the strategy is guaranteed to find the lowest cost path to a
  goal state.

- Branching factor $$b$$: The increase in the number of nodes on the fringe each time a fringe node
  is dequeued and replaced with its children is $$O(b)$$. At depth $$k$$ in the search tree, there exists $$O(b^k)$$ nodes.

- Maximum depth $$m$$

- The depth of the shallowest solution $$s$$



### DFS

Use a last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack as the fringe. The most recently added object has the highest priority. 

##### Properties

- DFS is not complete. DFS will stuck if there exists any cycle in the graph.

- DFS is not optimal. It always returns the leftmost solution in the search tree.

- The time complexity is $$O(b^m)$$. In the worst case, DFS explores the entire tree before reach the goal state.

- The space complexity is $$O(bm)$$. At each level, there are at most $$b$$ nodes in the fringe.
