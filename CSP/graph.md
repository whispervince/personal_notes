### Constraint Graph

Nodes represent variables and edges represent constraints.

Different types of constraints:

- Unary costraints - involves a single variable in the CSP, prunes the domain of the variables
- Binary constrains - involves two variables, represented in constraint graphs are traditional graph edges
- Higher-order constraints - involves three or more variables, represented with edges in a graph, look unconventional
