# Probabilistic Inference

### Introduction

##### Inference by Enumeration

Given a joint PDF, we can compute any desired probability $$P(Q_1, \ldots, Q_k | e_1, \ldots, e_k)$$ by collecting all the rows consistent with the evidence available ($$e_1, \ldots, e_k$$), and normalize the table to get a probability distribution.
